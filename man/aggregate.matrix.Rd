\arguments{
\item{object}{An expression matrix, cells by genes}

\item{k_neigh}{Number of cells to be aggregated per cluster.}

\item{atacbinary}{Logical, whether the aggregated scATAC-seq data need binary}

\item{max_overlap}{The maximum overlapping ratio of two clusters.}

\item{reduction_name}{The reduction name of extracting the cell coordinates used for aggregating.}

\item{size_factor_normalize}{Logical, should accessibility values be normalized by size factor}

\item{seed}{The seed used in randomly shuffling the data for cross-validation.}

\item{verbose}{Print detailed information.}
}
\value{
Seurat object with aggregated data
}
