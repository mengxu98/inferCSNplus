\usage{
crossweight(
  network_table,
  matrix,
  dynamic_object,
  lag = floor(ncol(matrix)/5),
  min = ceiling(ncol(matrix)/50),
  max = floor(ncol(matrix)/12),
  symmetric_filter = FALSE,
  filter_thresh = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{network_table}{GRN dataframe, the result of running reconstructargetRN or reconstructargetRN_GENIE3}

\item{matrix}{genes-by-cells expression matrix}

\item{dynamic_object}{result of running findDynGenes}

\item{lag}{lag window on which to run cross-correlation. Cross-correlaiton computed from -lag to +lag.}

\item{min}{minimum of weighting window. Edges with offsets (or absolute offsets if symmetric_filter=TRUE) less than min will not be negatively weighted.}

\item{max}{maximum of weighting window. Edges with offsets (or absolute offsets if symmetric_filter=TRUE) greater than max will have weights set to 0.}

\item{symmetric_filter}{whether or not to employ a symmetric weight scheme. If true, absolute offset is used in place of offset.}

\item{filter_thresh}{after crossweighting, edges with weights less than filter_thresh will be set to 0.}
}
\value{
network_table with offset and weighted_score added
