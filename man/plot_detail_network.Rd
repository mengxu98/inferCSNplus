  top_edges = NULL,
  only_TFs = TRUE,

  communities = NULL,
  compute_betweenness = TRUE

}
\arguments{
\item{network}{the dynamic network}

\item{regulators}{regulators}

\item{top_edges}{top_edges}

\item{only_TFs}{whether or not to only plot regulators and exclude non-regulators}

\item{network_order}{the network_order in which to plot epochs, or which epochs to plot}

\item{communities}{community assignments or the result of running find_commumities.
The names in this object should match the names of the epoch networks in network.
If NULL, it will be automatically run.}
